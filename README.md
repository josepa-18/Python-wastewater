### MAIN DATASET 
Drugs in municipal wastewater in selected European cities.
“Wastewater analysis is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring real-time data on geographical and temporal trends in illicit drug use. The EMCDDA works closely with the SCORE (Sewage analysis CORe) group which has been collecting and analysing this data since 2011. This data sets gives access to all source data and covers cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy).” Source: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/drugs-in-municipal-wastewater-in-selected-european-cities?locale=en
